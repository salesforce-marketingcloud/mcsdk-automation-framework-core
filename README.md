# Salesforce Marketing Cloud - Automation Swagger Framework SDK

## Overview
This repo is part of the Salesforce Marketing Cloud SDK Automation Framework. It holds the Open Api Specification json file which is used for the SDK Generation in four different languages (C#, Java, Php and Node). 

## Contents
- [Swagger Code Gen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) CLI
- [Open API Specification for Salesforce Marketing Cloud REST Routes](https://github.com/salesforce-marketingcloud/mcsdk-automation-framework-core/blob/master/resources/sfmc-openapi-v2.json)
- Python Scripts for SDK Automation  

## Getting Started

To add a new REST route to the generated SDK,
1. Create your own branch and modify the [Open API Spec file](https://github.com/salesforce-marketingcloud/mcsdk-automation-framework-core/blob/master/resources/sfmc-openapi-v2.json)
2. Make sure the format is correct without any errors. [Swagger Online Editor](https://editor.swagger.io/) is an amazing tool to play with the Open Api Spec files. It has the ability to identify formatting errors.
3. Push the changes to remote and create a PR against the Master branch from your branch.
4. This PR would trigger the Travis CI process. 
5. At the end of the CI Process, A new branch would be created on the [SDK Repo](https://github.com/salesforce-marketingcloud/mcsdk-automation-csharp). Also a PR would be created against the master branch. 
6. You can then download the SDK project and test the changes in the new branch. 
7. As of now, the process of merging the code to the Master branch is set to Manual for first phase. It would also be automated in future releases.
